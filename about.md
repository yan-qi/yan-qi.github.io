Sometimes I look back on what I have done in the past, I cannot even 
believe that I touched so many exciting things.

In 2009, I got my first full-time job with [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com). It was a R&D position. Since then, I have migrated my focus to the parallel DBMS and the distributed computation.
