Sometimes I look back on what I have done in the past, I cannot even 
believe that I touched so many exciting things.

In 2009, I got my first full-time job with [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com). It was a R&D position. Since then, I have migrated my focus to the parallel DBMS and the distributed computation.

Before I came to the U.S., I had got my B.S. and M.S. from the Computer Science Department at University of Science and Technology of China. In Fall 2004, I joined the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Arizona State University as a graduate student. This is the beginning of my journey towards a Ph.D. My adviser is Dr. K.Selcuk Candan. 

After graduating, I joined [Teradata Corp.](http://www.teradata.com), the world's largest company solely focused on creating enterprise agility through database software, enterprise data warehousing, data warehouse appliances, and analytics. Teradata has one of the best Parallel Database Management Systems (PDBMSs) in the world. My focus was on the integration of the Parallel DBMS with the Distributed File System (e.g., Hadoop DFS). 

Now I am working for [Turn Inc](http://www.turn.com), a startup company of the digital advertising industry. Particularly, my work is to exploit the distributed computing technology (such as Hadoop MapReduce) for the construction of data platform to store and manage large scale data.
