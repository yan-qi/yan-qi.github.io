Sometimes I look back on what I have done in the past, I cannot even 
believe that I touched so many exciting things.

When I was in [college](http://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/), I had a chance of working with a post-doc in our
department on the contented-based image retrieval (CBIR)[^1]. Clearly it was a
hard problem. For example, not like text, it is challenging to capture the user 
real intention. Moreover the image object recognition has been always an open problem.
Therefore, we proposed a different approach from the traditional submit-question-return-answer
search strategy. It is an interactive retrieval. In other words, it might not be able to return the
satisfactory result first, instead it invites the user to give its
feedback if the result is not perfect. An improved result will be given
in the following taking the user feedback into account, until the user
gets the right image, conceptually. 
The tools serving our purpose included [the BP neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) and the interactive genetic algorithm
([IGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_evolutionary_computation#IGA))[^2].

Then [ImageNet](www.image-net.org/) didn't exist in those years, so in our experiments, we had to crawl
many images from the Internet. Whereas the variety was a problem as most
of the images we got were landscape photos. You can image that the
quality of our work was kind of limited. 
However, working on this project was really an inspiring experience to me, as it opened a door to
an unknown world where I had never been.

Another interesting project that I got involved in my graduate school in the [USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) was to create a bridge health monitor system.

My advisor, Professor [Lu](http://dsxt.ustc.edu.cn/zj_ywjs.asp?zzid=322) led the effort to the software development.
Tentatively I created a BP neural network to predict the bridge health [^3].
