Sometimes I look back on what I have done in the past, I cannot even 
believe that I touched so many exciting things.

In 2009, I got my first full-time job with [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com). It was a R&D position. Since then, I have migrated my focus to the parallel DBMS and the distributed computation. Hadoop was rising as a super-star in the big data movement. 
Comparing with proprietary software, Hadoop is open source (i.e., *FREE*) and has an very active community, getting favors from small or middle business. 
As one of the important players in the field, Teradata does not want to be left behind in the race, even though it does actually lead in many aspects. However, Teradata sells its product and service, in most cases, very expensively. Most of its clients are big companies. 
 
One of my work was to explore the collaboration opportunities between Hadoop and Teradata RDBMS. For example, one application was to load data from the HDFS into the Teradata data warehouse[^1]. 
On the other hand, it is also possible to run the Hadoop MapReduce job on the Teradata data warehouse, through the customized input format classes[^2].
