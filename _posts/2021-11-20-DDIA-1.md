A successful data system should be able to meet various requirements while solving the data problems, including functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements. 
The functional requirements are often application specific, describing what to be done with the data and how the results can be achieved. 
In the nonfunctional requirements, there are many factors affecting the design and implementation, wherein three aspects are so important that all engineers should consider in the entire development cycle: reliability, scalability and maintainability.  

A data system is a *software* developed by *humans*, deployed and run in the environment composed of *hardwares*. It is important to make the system work correctly even when faults occurs. The problem can be caused by hardware faults (e.g., network interruption, disk failure, power outage), software issues (e.g., bugs) and human errors (e.g., misconfiguration, mistakes in operation). **Reliability** provides a guidance of fault-tolerance techniques.  

A data system can grow as it has an input with larger data or traffic volume, sometimes more complexity. We need a measurement of load and performance, based on which good strategies can be taken to keep performance good, i.e., to achieve a good **scalability**.  

Additionally a data system often has a long life cycle, therefore its **maintainability** plays a critical role. As it suggests, "good operations can often work around the limitations of bad software, but good software cannot run reliably with bad operations". Both engineering and operations teams should work together with the system.  

The book *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* tries to provide a good guidance in the design of data system with reliability, scalability and maintainability considered. Here I presented [the first chapter](/public/presentation/DDIA/ch1), as the start of a long journey.
