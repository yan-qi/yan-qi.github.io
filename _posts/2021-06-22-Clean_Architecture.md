![Built with simple rules: water, air, sun, gravity](/public/nature-1.jpeg)

Software development has many similarities with building construction. There are a few of  rules that seem simple, like the physics of gravity in the real physical world or the single responsibility principle (SRP) in the programming. However, not all developers can necessarily use them well, especially in the complex scenario. An architect should have a good understanding of those principles first, and grow a pair of sharp eyes to see through the complexity, such that she can apply those rules to achieve a clean architecture.  

Uncle Bob in his book, **Clean Architecture: A Craftman's Guide to Software Structure and Design** gives a detailed description on those principles. More importantly he tries to explain how *clean architecture* can be achieved with the help of them. As a result of reading and learning, I made a presentation based on the book, hopefully it could highlight the main points.
